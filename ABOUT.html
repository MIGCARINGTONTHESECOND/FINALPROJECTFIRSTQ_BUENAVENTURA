          ADVOCACY BACKGROUND
          </h2> 

          <p id="ADVOCACYBACKGROUND">
          <B> It all began during unit meet. Me and my PSHS teammates passed by a blood donation drive <br>
where there was a commotion within the organizers. It turned out that the blood was limited and <br>
lacking the minimum volunteers they weren't able to donate blood to those in need. After winning <br>
Unit meet and qualifying for DECAA we decided to use our current winnings and popularity to support <br>
these drives. But as it turns out more than just 1 donation drive was in dire need of <br>
help. So were people who lacked budget to afford to deliver a baby. <br> <br>

This led to many deaths and mistakes. Because of this my teammates and I decided to start <br>
a funding event which would have us volunteering to organize the event. But sadly we failed <br>
to organize the event due to budget and time constraints. Being PISAY scholars we stayed resilient <br>
and instead decided to create a web page which would reach out to spread awareness and present <br>
methods how to help. Without spending money and allowing everyone to help in their respective homes.<br>
The very website you're reading now. We hope to attract adolescents like us to be able to support <br>
this SDG and bring more people to help using different methods. </B> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

    <H4>ABOUT THE AUTHOR </H4>  
    <P id="abouttheauthor">
    <b>
My name is Carlos Miguel Rosello Buenaventura. An adolescent. I play football and am a son of <br>  
a doctor. I have seen the struggles of my father as a doctor and the struggles of patients who <br> 
can't afford to pay for their medicines and check ups. This is why I chose this advocacy.  <br>
To help those in need. To help those who can't help themselves. To help those who are suffering.<br>  <br> <br> <br>   

Because I believe that health is wealth.And I want to share this wealth with everyone. I am <br> 
also a PSHS scholar who serves the nation. And the people being under the nation it is my mission <br> 
and my personal goal to help and ensure their good health and well-being. But as of now my capability <br> 
has only reached this website. I hope you enjoy! </b>  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>
