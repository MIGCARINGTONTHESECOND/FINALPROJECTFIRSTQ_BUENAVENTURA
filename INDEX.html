        <h2> PROBLEM BACKGROUND </h2> 

    <p  id="PROBLEMBG">
      <b>
The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being focuses on promoting healthy <br> 
lives and well-being for all. Despite progress,  health challenges persist everywhere. For example, the global<br>
maternal mortality ratio was estimated at 197 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2023, though it is projected <br>
to decrease with efforts in the health industry (World Health Organization, 2023). Another example is communicable <br>
 diseases such as AIDS and HIV, which continue to harm populations, with tuberculosis—one of the leading infectious <br>
 killers globally—causing 1.5 million deaths in 2020 alone (World Health Organization, 2021). <br><br>

In the Philippines, the government has aligned its overall framework for health programs around SDG 3, but its budget <br>
for public health expenditure has been cut by 3.5% (Healthcare Asia Magazine, 2025). The challenges of solving local health <br>
problems persist today. One of these is dengue, a disease that has caused thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths in recent <br> 
years. From January to June 2025, there were 437 dengue-related deaths and 123,000 dengue cases locally (Sirbough, 2025). <br>
These statistics show that, united, achieving good health and well-being heavily requires stronger healthcare systems,  <br>
preventive measures, community effort, and, most importantly, proper funding.

    <h4> WHAT IS BEING DONE</h4>
    
<p  id="WHATDONE">
  <b>
  Globally, the UN have created many programs worldwide that have improved the health of humans. Alongside <br>
  setting up goals to provide a framework for countries to build around. Countries such as the Philippines. <br>
  Where in the Philippines there are multiple efforts being done in order to try to help solve these problems today. <br>
   First, with programs,the Philippines quickly upgraded and improved its facilities as early as 2009 (Huntington <br> 
   et al., 2011). Alongside new studies, the Philippines was able to decrease its maternal mortality percentage. <br>
    Second, the Philippines has partnered with the <br><br>
      
      CDC, which handles disease threats such as HIV and other communicable diseases, where they monitor and <br>
      try to prevent them from worsening. Alongside supporting each other to build capacity on monitoring, handling,<br>
       and responding to diseases (CDC in Philippines, 2024). Lastly, the Philippines, with the support of organizations, <br>
        placed its efforts to stop the spread of dengue, especially during rainy seasons. Using cleanup programs <br> 
        to prevent dengue and other diseases (Sirbough,2025). Including an increase of 23.6 percent in healthcare <br>
        funding by the government.
